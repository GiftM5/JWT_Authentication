## TASK ONE (Secure a mobile app with JSON web tokens (JWTs).)

* Good afternoon,

* Great to have you as part of the team! We’re excited to see your work and for you to be involved in some exciting projects.

* Your first task is to build a JWT-based authentication application in Java. You must build the app using the Spring Boot framework. Include Spring Web and Spring Security as dependencies.

* When running the application, it should expose a single endpoint mapped to “/authenticate”. Specification for this endpoint is as follows:

* Create a single REST HTTP POST API.
* Request body should include a username and password.
* Response should include an authentication token.
* For now, you do not need to create a database to store usernames and hashed passwords. Instead, you can simply hardcode the values of a user and their hashed password into a file that should be read when the endpoint authenticates data from the request body.

* When finished with development, please send me all your files compressed into a folder for the team to conduct a code review.

* Best regards
